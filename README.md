# OOEDS JSON Schema
JSON schema describing the abstract information metamodel underlying the Object-Oriented Environmental Data System (OOEDS).

Schema documents should be useful for validating the metadata structures of specific implementations of OOEDS against the abstract model.

Documentation and scripts for developing a MongoDB implementation of the OOEDS is also included.
