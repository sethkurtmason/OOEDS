  "$comment": "A Model aggregates one or more Evaluations to create a logical grouping of data. A Model is a special type of Evaluation, which implies that a given data aggregation is potentially a tier in a composition (or holonic) hierarchy of Evaluations. Most researchers choose to think about, collect, and organize data sets rather than track long lists of data independently. Furthermore, a given Model represents a holon in a hierarchy, meaning it is composed of simpler evaluation structures (lower-tier holons) and is potentially a component of a more complex evaluation structure (higher-tier holon).",
