Entities may describe physical components of a landscape (e.g. soil), individual organisms (e.g. a pit-tagged fish), cadastral features (e.g. private property bounds), named geographic locations (e.g. study sites), conceptual environmental components, etc. An Entity may be related to one or more Entities. As with Activities, this may be implemented as either a directed or undirected graph, allowing either a composition or network perspective. The ability to track compositional hierarchies or network relationships among Entities is useful for understanding the nested relationships between geographic (e.g. climatic region), cadastral (e.g. property ownership), physical (e.g. soil), or biological (e.g. taxonomies) Entities.",
