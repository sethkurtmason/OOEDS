An Activity may describe field collection campaigns, automated instrument deployments, instrument calibrations, data analysis workflows, data derivations, model simulations, censoring actions, etc. An Activity may be related to one or more associated Activities. As such, Activities are organized into a graph data structure representing a network. While our abstract design depicts an undirected graph, the self-referencing relationship could be implemented as composition, which would allow activities to be organized in a directed graph representing a composition hierarchy. The ability to track composition or network relationships among Activities is useful for tying detailed and, potentially, evolving provenance information directly to an Evaluation.",

An Agent may be related to one or more Agents. As with activities, this may be implemented as either a directed or undirected graph, allowing either a composition or network perspective. This structure provides a means for identifying the human, organizational, or business relationships that exist between groups or individuals involved in data collection, management and analysis.",
